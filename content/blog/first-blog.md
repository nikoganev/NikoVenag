Welcome ! This is my first blog post that I ever created in my life. As such I would like to introduce myself and let you know what you can expect reading here. 

My name is Niko and I like multitasking! My blogposts will not be the typical ones that are focused only on 1 area. I like doing many things at the same time and this is how I keep myself happy and productive. Through the years I understood that when I do the same job for a long time I get bored and not productive. 

Currently I'm working as a System Engineer in a Fintech Sector and also giving part time consultancy on Web development and Marketing. In the rest of my time I upload Crossfit motivational videos on 2 youtube channels. Ah, and not to forget that I like to follow the stock and crypto markets. I was day trading for a few years, trying to find an edge over the market. Unfortunately I was never profitable but I learnt a lot on the Psychology and mindset part.

I consider my trading experience being my biggest school in life. Well, I paid my tuition there but it was the only one that gave me an insight over companies, financial statements, management etc. Something that I would have never been able to learn if I went through the typical University path. Ah, and not to forget that I did went through that path for 3 years and I was miserable since the first day. 

"So.. what would you be writing about ?" This is the question you may already have. There is no simple answer but some of the topics would be: Technology, Crypto and Stock analysis, Motivation and Psychology.

Happy reading,

Niko

P.S "It's all about positivity"
